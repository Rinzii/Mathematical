# Mim
### A modern math framework for real time graphics.


## Features
- (WIP) Robust implementation of common 3D math objects. Including vectors, matrices, quaternions, and more.
- (WIP) Supports efficient SIMD operations on all math objects along with efficient structure packing for non-SIMD operations.
- Various utility functions for common math operations.
- (WIP) Implementation of common graphics algorithms such as ray tracing, and intersection tests.
- Lightweight and portable. No external dependencies.
- Using modern C++20 features with a focus of maintaining support from C+20 and onwards.

> Currently Mim is still in development and is not ready for production use. Expect many bugs and missing features. Along with constant API change till we reach a stable release!
