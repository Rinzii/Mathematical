# Mim
### A modern math framework for real time graphics.
[![build Status](https://github.com/Rinzii/mim/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Rinzii/mim/actions/workflow/ci.yml)


## Features
- (WIP) Robust implementation of common 3D math objects. Including vectors, matrices, quaternions, and more.
- (WIP) Supports efficient SIMD operations on all math objects along with efficient structure packing for non-SIMD operations.
- Various utility functions for common math operations.
- (WIP) Implementation of common graphics algorithms such as ray tracing, and intersection tests.
- Lightweight and portable. No external dependencies.
- (WIP) Using modern C++17 and C++20 features with a focus of supporting down to C++17.

> Currently Mim is still in development and is not ready for production use. Expect many bugs and missing features. Along with constant API change till we reach a stable release!
